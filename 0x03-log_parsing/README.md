## Description

This project is a simple log parsing tool that reads a log file and outputs the number of unique IP addresses and the number of unique IP addresses per day.
<br>

Log Parsing involves extracting structured data from unstructured log files generated by software applications, servers, or systems. By parsing and analyzing log files, engineers can gain insights into system behavior, identify issues, and monitor performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher

## Usage

To run the script, execute the following command:

```bash
./<you-log-file> | ./0-stats.py
```

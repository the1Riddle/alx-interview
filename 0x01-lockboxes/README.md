### Acknowledgment

> Concepts Used:

1. ***Lists and List Manipulation:***
   - Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically
   - Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)

2. ***Graph Theory Basics:***
   - Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.
   - Graph Theory (Khan Academy)

3. ***Algorithmic Complexity:***
   - Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.
   - Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)

4. ***Recursion:***
   - Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.
   - Recursion in Python (Real Python)

 5. ***Queue and Stack:***
    - Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.
    - Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)

 6. ***Set Operations:***
    - Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.

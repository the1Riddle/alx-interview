# 0x00. Pascal's Triangle

<p align="center">
  <b>Must Know</b>

<p align="center">For the successful completion of this project, these python concepts were revisited:

</p>

### *Lists and List Comprehensions:*

- Understand how to create, access, modify, and iterate over lists.
- Utilize list comprehensions for more concise and readable code, especially for generating rows of Pascal’s Triangle.
  
### *Functions:*

- Know how to define and call functions.
- Pass parameters and return values, particularly how to return a list of lists representing Pascal’s Triangle.
  
### *Loops:*

- Use for and while loops to iterate through sequences.
- Nested loops may be necessary for generating each row and calculating the values of Pascal’s Triangle.
  
### *Conditional Statements:*

- Apply if, elif, and else conditions to implement logic based on the position within Pascal’s Triangle (e.g., the edges of the triangle always being 1).
 
### *Recursion (Optional):*

- While not strictly necessary, understanding recursion can provide an alternative approach to generating Pascal’s Triangle.
- Recognize base cases and recursive cases for a function that generates the triangle’s rows.
  
### *Arithmetic Operations:*

- Perform addition, a fundamental operation for calculating each element of Pascal’s Triangle as the sum of the two elements directly above it.
  
### *Indexing and Slicing:*

- Access elements and slices of lists, crucial for identifying and summing the correct elements when constructing each row of the triangle.

### *Memory Management:*

- Be mindful of how lists are stored and copied, especially when creating new rows based on the values of the previous row.

### *Error and Exception Handling (Optional):*

- Use try-except blocks as needed to handle potential errors, such as invalid input types or values.

### *Efficiency and Optimization:*

Consider the time and space complexity of different approaches to generating Pascal’s Triangle.
Evaluate and apply optimizations to improve the performance of the solution.
